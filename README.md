# OnePay Payment Gateway

## Project Overview
OnePay is a secure and scalable payment gateway designed to handle high transaction volumes while prioritizing security. The system uses AES encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), tokenization, and fraud detection techniques to ensure data protection and minimize risk. This project is built using modern backend and frontend technologies, integrated with external services, and optimized for performance and scalability.

## What I learnt

### 1. **Security Measures**
   - **AES 256-bit Encryption**: Provides strong data protection through block cipher encryption.
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Secures login with a combination of username, password, and One-Time Password (OTP) via SMS.
   - **Tokenization**: Replaces sensitive data with tokens to reduce breach risks.
   - **Fraud Detection**: Utilizes behavioral analytics to track and identify suspicious activity.

### 2. **Technologies Used**
   - **Backend**: Cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud), Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), and relational databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL.
   - **Frontend**: React, Angular, or Vue.js for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
   - **APIs**: RESTful APIs and secure API gateways to manage communication and protect data.

### 3. **Scalability and Performance**
   - **Load Balancers**: Ensures even distribution of traffic across multiple servers.
   - **Redundancy**: Failover systems maintain continuous service during server failures.
   - **Optimizations**: Use of asynchronous processing, caching strategies, and microservices architecture for enhanced performance.

### 4. **Risk Management**
   - **Security Risks**: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), input validation, and penetration testing.
   - **Transaction Integrity**: ACID-compliant database management and transaction logs for auditing.
   - **Data Privacy**: Sensitive data encryption and strict access control.
   - **Compliance**: Adherence to PCI DSS and GDPR standards for handling payment data.

### 5. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive testing of key features, such as login, fund transfer, and wallet management, ensuring proper system functionality.

### 6. **Development Process**
   - **Agile Methodology**: Developed in sprints with continuous testing and iterative improvements.
   - **User Feedback**: Focus on usability testing and enhancements based on feedback.
